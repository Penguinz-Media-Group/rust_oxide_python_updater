# License Conflict?
TL;DR: You can use it, but any changes need to be upstreamed, and it is meant for personal use only... commercial use restricted.

# FOSS vs Premium
We will maintain at least 50 percent of our functions as FOSS, but will also maintain a premium compiled version which will help cover maintenance fees.
